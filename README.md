# Welcome
This proyect is about simulating a well known MOOC (Masive Online Open Courses).
I have taken by reference edx.org to take some ideas and develop my owns.
It has been done at Web App Development first course @ I.E.S. María de Zayas y Sotomayor, Madrid (Spain).

# Things to keep in mind
- By now, I don´t know how to make a proper responsive web page so I suggest you to visualize this project with resolution higher or equal to 1680 x 1080 (1920 x 1080 recommended).
Future projects will be full responsive, I´m working on it :) .

- Don´t try to register, that functionality is not implemented because this page is not going to be official/commercial... the only purpose is apply things that I have learnt studying html + css.

- If you want to explore the web page you can use this fake account at logging section:
User: test2@gmail.com
Password: qwerty

- Changing user picture only can be done locally.


# Thanks for visiting!!!
I hope you enjoy this project, I know that some code must be refactored, some things can be done better and some things must be changed... but I need some time to study all the exams that are coming...

Farewell!!
